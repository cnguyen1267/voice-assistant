Goal:
Push to talk but for the entire computer

Roadmap:
Figure out triggering recording from keypress in app, in browser, on the entire computer

Iterate on transcription accuracy and SPEED VERY IMPORTANT (sampling params beam search etc)
Possibly enable finetuning the model on voice samples (this sounds like it would obviously be extremely useful but unclear how to do)
